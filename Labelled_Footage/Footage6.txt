Footage taken from: VIRB0024.MP4, .... ,VIRB0024-6.MP4
Date: 02/22/19
Ride ID: 15963
Description:
	Started at 10:42am. Surf was 3-5ft. big. Some wipeouts. 
	Used a (different) 16GB microSD card for this footage so the
videos are broken down by the 7 minute mark rather than the 25:01 mark. 
May need to just do the calculations by hand in case it messes up the "new" 
field. But will inspect Alina's code to see if it handles this case.
